# ðŸ“¦ ghub.io

Redirect to an npm package's GitHub page, if available.

## Web Usage

These links will take you to each package's GitHub repo:

- [ghub.io/express](https://ghub.io/express)
- [ghub.io/choo](https://ghub.io/choo)
- [ghub.io/puppeteer](https://ghub.io/puppeteer)

This link redirects to npm, because no GitHub repo will be found for the given package name:

- [ghub.io/some-nonexistent-package](https://ghub.io/some-nonexistent-package)

If you're looking for a quick way to get to an npm package page, use npm's 
shorter `npm.im` domain, like [npm.im/express](https://npm.im/express).

## CLI Usage

`ghub` is also available as a command-line tool which accepts one or many
package names and opens their GitHub repos in your web browser:

```sh
npm i -g ghub
ghub choo chai chalk
```

The CLI can also read from newline-delimited standard input. Here's an example
that opens the repos of the top ten most-dependend-on packages whose names 
start with `level`:

```sh
npm i -g ghub all-the-package-names
all-the-package-names | egrep '^level' | head -n 10 | ghub
```
